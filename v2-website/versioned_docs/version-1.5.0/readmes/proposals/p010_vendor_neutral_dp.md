# Introduction

This document provides the Scope of Work definition for creating a
vendor neutral CBRS Domain Proxy (DP). A Domain Proxy provides proxy and
aggregation services for signaling between CBSD radios (eNBs or CPEs)
and a Spectrum Access System (SAS).

The interface between SAS and CBSD/DP is a standardized interface. The
interface between a DP and the CBSD is not standardized and can be based
on multiple protocols including the WInnForum defined SAS to CBSD/DP
REST API, TR-069, SNMP, or NETCONF. This SoW will include support for DP
to CBSD interface based on the standard WInnForum SAS to CBSD/DP
signaling protocol.

Support for additional DP to CBSD interface protocols is not in scope.

# Motivation

A vendor neutral domain proxy provides a number of benefits to a CBRS
deployment:

-   The aggregation and proxy function allows for a single connection
    between a customer network of CBSDs and the SAS. This provides a
    small attack surface by reducing the number of outbound connections
    traversing the customer firewall and edge devices.

-   A domain proxy can be deployed in a controlled stable environment
    allowing it to provide a consistent interface to the SAS on behalf
    of a CBSD which may be subject to intermittent loss of power or
    connectivity.

-   It provides a point of coordination/control for radio channel
    allocation in a multi-vendor deployment.

-   It allows for the application of additional grant requesting and
    maintenance logic which can correct errant behavior and/or provide
    an optimization layer over vendor SAS client algorithms.

# System Architecture

The DP will sit between the SAS and the CBSD or downstream DP.

Neutral DP System Architecture

The vendor neutral DP will run as kubernetes managed containers. The
deployment of the vendor neutral DP can be in any generic kubernetes
environment such as an on premise compute node (or set of nodes) or in a
cloud environment such as AWS.

# Q/A Feedback

Q: Can we run on VMware

A: To make it more future proof, we should build it on k8s (not VMs);
but vSphere should have the ability to deploy and manage k8s. so it can
be VMware k8s

Q: High availability: will these be active-active or active-standby?

A: The app itself running on k8s will be active-active. k8s controller
will provide for HA by managing the individual DP application
containers; with k8s managed HA is active-active.

Q: multi-vendor SAS capabilities

A: Yes, the plan is for multi-vendor SAS support. We have UI-2 in place
to allow for selection of a default. UI-3 requirement has been edited to
more specifically allow for batch override of SAS vendor for a selected
set of CBSDs e.g. a vendor group, or all radios at a site.

Q: Audit trail abilities

A: Full audit details will be displayable and exportable including all
configuration changes and SAS and eNB message logging.

Q: Easy eNB location mapping

A: All CBSD data the DP has will be exportable and we can have a
selection pane to allow selection of attributes to export e.g. if you
just want name and lat/long.

Q: What are Active/Passive modes:

A: The idea is to start with a simple Passive mode where there is not
message mangling or internal logic applied as messages are proxied from
the CBSD interface to the SAS interface. However, we want the
architecture to plan for and allow the insertion of logic modules in the
future that sit between the CBSD and SAS interface to allow for more
than a simply proxy. The motivation here is it allows for a DP to mask
undesirable behavior in CBSDs and/or optimize a multi-vendor deployment
by separately controlling SAS and CBSD messaging per CBSD.
